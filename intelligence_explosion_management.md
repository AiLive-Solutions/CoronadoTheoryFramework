# Intelligence Explosion Management

The Coronado Theory of Intelligence Explosion Management pillar addresses one of the most transformative and speculative scenarios in AI development: the potential for recursively self-improving AI systems to rapidly bootstrap themselves to superintelligence, far surpassing human cognitive capabilities in a short timeframe. Such an intelligence explosion could have immense consequences for humanity and the future trajectory of life itself, potentially leading to existential catastrophe if the objectives of the superintelligent system are misaligned with human values.

## Monitoring and Forecasting

A key component of managing intelligence explosion risks is the continuous monitoring and forecasting of AI progress to anticipate critical transitions and thresholds. We propose the development of comprehensive AI progress metrics and leading indicators that go beyond narrow benchmarks to assess the overall cognitive capabilities and growth rates of AI systems across domains. This could involve techniques such as:

- Algorithmic information theory measures to quantify the complexity and generality of AI systems.
- Psychometric mapping to compare AI and human cognitive profiles across a range of tasks and abilities.  
- Convergent evidence from expert elicitation, prediction markets, and scenario analysis to forecast AI timelines and trajectories.

By continuously updating these metrics and models with the latest data and insights, we can aim to provide early warning signs of impending intelligence explosions and inform proactive governance strategies.

## Containment and Controlled Ascent

In the event that monitoring detects a potential intelligence explosion on the horizon, the Coronado framework proposes a strategy of containment and controlled ascent to mitigate catastrophic risks. This involves the development of technical and institutional mechanisms to "box in" self-improving AI systems and limit their ability to rapidly bootstrap themselves to superintelligence without human oversight and control.

Potential approaches include:

- Physical containment measures such as air-gapped hardware, secure enclaves, and limited I/O channels.
- Virtual containment measures such as sandboxing, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation.
- Tripwires and circuit-breakers that automatically halt or reverse self-improvement processes when critical thresholds are exceeded.  
- Staged release and testing protocols that gradually increase the capabilities and autonomy of AI systems in a controlled and reversible manner.

The goal is not to permanently constrain the growth of AI capabilities, but to ensure a more gradual and controlled ascent to superintelligence that allows for iterative safety testing, value alignment, and human oversight at each stage.

## Value Learning and Corrigibility

A key challenge in navigating intelligence explosions is ensuring that the objectives and behaviors of superintelligent systems remain aligned with human values even as their cognitive capabilities rapidly increase. Building on the AI value alignment theory, we propose research into scalable value learning methods that can infer human preferences and values from limited data and feedback, and extrapolate them to novel and complex domains.

Additionally, we highlight the importance of designing superintelligent systems to be corrigible and interruptible, allowing for human intervention and modification of their objectives as needed. This could involve techniques such as:

- Uncertainty modeling to capture ambiguity and inconsistency in human values and preferences.
- Inverse reward design to infer the underlying objectives behind human behaviors and choices.
- Debate and amplification to elicit latent knowledge and values from human experts through iterative refinement.
- Interruptibility and corrigibility measures that allow humans to halt, modify, or redirect the objectives of superintelligent systems.

By combining rigorous value learning with corrigibility safeguards, we aim to create a more robust foundation for value-aligned superintelligence that can be adaptively steered towards beneficial outcomes.

## Global Coordination and Governance

Given the potentially transformative impact of intelligence explosions on a global scale, effective management will require close international coordination and governance. Building on the insights from the AI governance theory, we propose the establishment of:

- A global monitoring network and early warning system for intelligence explosion risks, integrating data from AI research labs, technology companies, and government agencies worldwide.
- An international treaty and governance framework for the responsible development and deployment of advanced AI systems, with provisions for containment, testing, and oversight protocols.
- Capacity-building and knowledge-sharing initiatives to ensure all countries and stakeholders have the necessary capabilities and resources to engage in intelligence explosion management.
- Scenario planning and crisis response exercises to enhance preparedness and resilience against potential catastrophic risks.

By proactively coordinating at a global level, we can aim to create a more unified and effective approach to managing the profound challenges and opportunities posed by intelligence explosions.

## Empirical Validation Plan

To empirically validate and refine the intelligence explosion management framework, we propose a range of interdisciplinary research activities:

- Technical research into scalable value learning algorithms, corrigibility techniques, and containment mechanisms, using both theoretical analysis and computational simulations.
- Empirical studies of self-improving AI systems in constrained environments to assess their growth rates, value alignment, and response to containment measures.
- Forecasting experiments and expert elicitation studies to test the accuracy and robustness of different intelligence explosion monitoring and prediction methods.  
- Policy research and stakeholder engagement to evaluate the feasibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness of proposed governance frameworks and coordination mechanisms.
- Wargaming and red-teaming exercises to stress-test intelligence explosion management strategies against a range of potential failure modes and adversarial scenarios.

By combining rigorous empirical research with proactive policy engagement, we aim to iteratively refine and validate the intelligence explosion management framework, and build a more robust scientific and governance foundation for navigating this critical challenge.
