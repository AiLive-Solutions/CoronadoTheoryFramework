# Evaluation and Accountability

The Coronado Theory of Evaluation and Accountability pillar focuses on establishing rigorous and transparent mechanisms for assessing the performance, impact, and alignment of AI systems, and holding developers and deployers accountable for their outcomes. As AI systems become more complex and consequential, it is critical to develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks and accountability structures to ensure they are safe, reliable, and beneficial.

## Multi-Level Evaluation Framework

A key component of the evaluation and accountability theory is the development of a multi-level framework for assessing AI systems across different dimensions and stages of their lifecycle. This involves going beyond narrow performance metrics to holistically evaluate the technical, ethical, social, and environmental implications of AI systems.

The multi-level evaluation framework includes assessment at the following levels:

- Technical performance: Evaluating the accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and scalability of AI models and algorithms using domain-specific benchmarks, metrics, and testing methodologies.
- Safety and security: Assessing the resilience of AI systems to errors, failures, and adversarial attacks, and their adherence to safety and security best practices and standards.
- Fairness and non-discrimination: Measuring the disparate impact and biases of AI systems across different demographic groups and contexts, and their compliance with fairness and non-discrimination laws and principles.
- Privacy and data protection: Evaluating the data governance and privacy practices of AI systems, including data collection, storage, sharing, and use, and their compliance with privacy regulations and ethical norms.
- Transparency and explainability: Assessing the interpretability and explainability of AI models and decisions, and the adequacy of documentation and communication about their functioning and limitations.
- Social and environmental impact: Measuring the broader societal and environmental consequences of AI systems, including effects on employment, inequality, social cohesion, human rights, and sustainability.
- Value alignment and ethical compliance: Evaluating the alignment of AI systems with human values and ethical principles, and their adherence to ethical guidelines and frameworks.

The multi-level AI evaluation framework (Figure 15) provides a comprehensive approach to assessing AI systems across different dimensions and stages of their lifecycle. It highlights the key levels of evaluation, from technical performance and safety to social impact and ethical alignment, and the relationships and dependencies between them. The framework emphasizes the importance of holistic and context-aware evaluation that goes beyond narrow performance metrics to consider the broader implications of AI systems.

## Participatory and Transparent Evaluation Processes

To ensure the legitimacy and accountability of AI evaluation, the Coronado framework proposes the adoption of participatory and transparent evaluation processes that involve diverse stakeholders and enable public scrutiny. This involves going beyond expert-driven assessment to include the perspectives and values of affected communities and the broader public.

Key elements of participatory and transparent AI evaluation include:

- Stakeholder engagement: Involving relevant stakeholders, including developers, users, regulators, civil society organizations, and affected communities, in the design and execution of AI evaluation processes.
- Public communication and reporting: Regularly communicating the results and methodologies of AI evaluations to the public in accessible and understandable formats, and enabling public feedback and dialogue.
- Independent auditing and verification: Engaging independent third-party auditors and verification bodies to assess the validity, reliability, and objectivity of AI evaluations, and to identify potential conflicts of interest or biases.
- Open data and reproducibility: Making evaluation data, models, and code publicly available and reproducible, subject to privacy and security constraints, to enable external validation and replication of results.
- Participatory assessment and co-design: Directly involving affected communities and stakeholders in the assessment and co-design of AI systems that impact them, using methods such as participatory action research and community-based auditing.

The participatory and transparent AI evaluation process (Figure 16) illustrates the inclusive and accountable approach to assessing AI systems. It depicts the range of stakeholders involved, from developers and regulators to affected communities and the public, and the various mechanisms for participation and transparency, such as stakeholder engagement, public reporting, independent auditing, open data, and participatory assessment. The process emphasizes the importance of democratic deliberation and public accountability in the evaluation of AI systems.

## Accountability and Redress Mechanisms

To hold AI developers and deployers accountable for the outcomes and impacts of their systems, the Coronado framework proposes the establishment of clear and enforceable accountability and redress mechanisms. This involves creating legal and institutional structures that assign responsibility, liability, and remediation obligations for AI harms and misuse.

Key accountability and redress mechanisms for AI include:

- Legal and regulatory frameworks: Developing and enforcing laws, regulations, and standards that establish clear obligations and liabilities for AI developers and deployers, and penalties for non-compliance or harm.
- Algorithmic impact assessments: Requiring AI developers and deployers to conduct and disclose comprehensive assessments of the potential impacts and risks of their systems before deployment, and to mitigate identified harms.
- Incident reporting and investigation: Establishing mandatory reporting and investigation processes for AI incidents, accidents, and near-misses, and creating dedicated bodies to conduct independent investigations and assign responsibility.
- Liability and compensation schemes: Creating clear liability frameworks and compensation schemes for AI harms, including mechanisms for affected individuals and communities to seek redress and remediation.
- Whistleblower protections and public participation: Providing legal protections and incentives for whistleblowers who report AI misuse or misconduct, and enabling public participation in AI accountability processes through mechanisms such as citizen suits and class actions.

The AI accountability and redress mechanisms (Figure 17) depict the legal and institutional structures needed to hold AI developers and deployers responsible for the outcomes and impacts of their systems. It shows the key mechanisms, such as legal frameworks, impact assessments, incident reporting, liability schemes, and whistleblower protections, and the relationships between them in creating a comprehensive accountability system. The figure emphasizes the importance of both proactive and reactive measures for ensuring AI accountability and providing redress for harms.

## Empirical Validation Plan

To empirically validate and refine the evaluation and accountability framework, we propose a range of interdisciplinary research activities:

- Benchmarking and standardization initiatives to develop robust and widely accepted evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols for different AI domains and applications.
- Empirical case studies and impact evaluations to assess the effectiveness, validity, and reliability of different AI evaluation methodologies and accountability mechanisms in real-world contexts.
- Participatory research and co-design projects to engage diverse stakeholders, especially affected communities, in the development and testing of AI evaluation and accountability approaches.
- Comparative policy analysis and legal research to identify best practices and lessons learned from AI governance and accountability frameworks across different jurisdictions and sectors.
- Longitudinal studies and socio-technical experiments to assess the long-term and systemic impacts of AI evaluation and accountability interventions on the development and use of AI systems.

By combining rigorous empirical research with inclusive stakeholder engagement, we aim to develop a robust and context-sensitive evidence base for AI evaluation and accountability. Ongoing monitoring, learning, and adaptation will be essential to ensure the framework remains responsive to the rapidly evolving AI landscape and societal concerns.
