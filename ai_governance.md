# AI Governance

The Coronado Framework for AI Governance pillar proposes a comprehensive and adaptive approach to governing the development and deployment of AI systems in the public interest. Given the far-reaching implications of AI, it is essential that the development and regulation of the technology are guided by the input and values of diverse constituencies, including researchers, policymakers, civil society organizations, affected communities, and the general public.

## Participatory Governance Process

A key principle of the framework is the inclusive participation of all stakeholders in the governance process. To enable meaningful public engagement, we propose the establishment of participatory governance mechanisms such as:

- Citizen assemblies and juries that involve representative samples of the public in deliberating on key AI policy issues and providing input to decision-makers.
- Multi-stakeholder forums and working groups that bring together experts and practitioners from different sectors to collaboratively develop guidelines and best practices.  
- Public consultations and hearings that solicit broad input on proposed AI regulations and governance frameworks.
- Participatory design and co-creation processes that directly involve affected communities in the development of AI systems that impact them.

The participatory AI governance process (Figure 5) highlights the inclusive, multi-stakeholder approach to governing the development and deployment of AI systems in the public interest. It depicts the range of stakeholders involved, from researchers and policymakers to civil society and the general public, and the various participatory mechanisms through which they can shape AI governance frameworks. These mechanisms, such as citizen assemblies, public consultations, and participatory design processes, ensure that the diverse values, needs, and concerns of different constituencies are represented in the governance process.

## Adaptive Regulatory Framework

Given the rapid pace of AI development and the complex, evolving nature of its societal impacts, traditional top-down, command-and-control approaches to regulation are likely to be inadequate. The Coronado Framework thus proposes an adaptive, polycentric approach to AI regulation that is flexible, context-aware, and responsive to changing circumstances. 

Key features of this adaptive regulatory framework include:

- Soft law mechanisms such as industry standards, codes of conduct, and voluntary guidelines that can adapt more quickly than formal legal regulations.
- Regulatory sandboxes and testbeds that provide controlled environments for experimentation with new AI technologies and governance approaches.
- Sunset clauses and periodic reviews that require the regular re-evaluation and adjustment of AI regulations based on updated evidence and feedback.
- Monitoring and enforcement mechanisms that leverage advanced AI techniques for auditing, anomaly detection, and compliance checking.

The adaptive AI regulation cycle (Figure 6) illustrates the iterative, context-aware approach to regulating AI systems in a rapidly evolving technological and societal landscape. It depicts the key stages of the regulatory process, from the initial development of soft law mechanisms like industry standards and guidelines, to the real-world testing and incremental refinement of these mechanisms based on ongoing monitoring and evaluation. This adaptive approach allows for the agile evolution of AI regulation in response to new evidence, stakeholder feedback, and changing circumstances.

## Global Coordination Mechanisms

As AI systems transcend national boundaries and have global impacts, effective AI governance will require international cooperation and coordination. The Coronado Framework proposes several mechanisms to facilitate global AI governance:

- International forums and institutions, such as an Intergovernmental Panel on AI (IPAI), that enable multilateral dialogue and knowledge-sharing on AI governance issues.
- A global AI incident reporting and response mechanism to rapidly share information and coordinate responses to AI accidents or misuse.
- Capacity-building initiatives to support the development of AI governance capabilities in all countries and stakeholder groups.
- Harmonized standards and interoperability protocols to enable consistent AI governance across jurisdictions.
- Multilateral commitments and treaties on the responsible development and use of AI systems.

The global AI governance coordination mechanisms (Figure 7) highlight the importance of international cooperation and knowledge-sharing in the effective governance of AI systems that transcend national boundaries. It depicts key mechanisms such as international forums and institutions, incident reporting and response systems, and capacity-building initiatives that enable the global coordination of AI governance efforts. The bidirectional arrows between these mechanisms emphasize their interactive and mutually reinforcing dynamics in fostering a coherent and responsive global governance ecosystem.

## Empirical Validation Plan

To empirically validate and refine the AI governance framework, we propose a range of interdisciplinary research activities:

- Comparative case studies of AI governance approaches across different countries, sectors, and application domains to identify best practices and common challenges.
- Stakeholder surveys and interviews to solicit input on the effectiveness, legitimacy, and inclusiveness of different governance mechanisms.
- Simulation studies and policy experiments to test the robustness and adaptiveness of regulatory frameworks under different scenarios.
- Longitudinal impact assessments to track the societal consequences of AI systems and governance decisions over time.
- Participatory action research to co-design and pilot governance innovations with affected communities and stakeholders.

By combining qualitative and quantitative methods, and engaging stakeholders as active research partners, we aim to develop a rigorous evidence base for adaptive and participatory AI governance. Ongoing monitoring, evaluation and adjustment will be critical to ensure the framework remains fit for purpose as AI capabilities and impacts evolve.
