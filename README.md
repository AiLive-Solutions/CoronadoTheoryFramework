# Coronado Theory: A Comprehensive Framework for Beneficial AI Development

The Coronado Theory is a set of interdisciplinary frameworks developed by Mario Coronado in collaboration with AI, aimed at ensuring the responsible and beneficial development of artificial intelligence (AI). The theory spans ten key pillars:

1. AI Value Alignment
2. Machine Consciousness
3. AI Governance
4. Intelligence Explosion Management
5. Inclusive AI Transition
6. Ethical Foundations
7. Technical Specificity
8. Diversity and Inclusion
9. Evaluation and Accountability
10. AI Safety

## Overview

The rapid advancement of AI presents immense opportunities for transformative benefits, but also poses significant challenges and risks. The Coronado Theory integrates insights from computer science, cognitive science, philosophy, and the social sciences to provide a unified foundation for the technical, ethical, and societal considerations critical to the future of AI.

The theory presents novel computational models, empirical methodologies, and governance frameworks to tackle key challenges, and discusses implications for the safe and beneficial development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Through proactive research, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and value-aligned design, the Coronado Theory aims to steer the trajectory of AI towards a flourishing future for humanity and all sentient beings.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the implementation of the Coronado Theory framework, organized into the following directories:

- `docs/`: Contains detailed documentation for each of the ten pillars of the theory.
- `figures/`: Contains visual illustrations and diagrams referenced in the documentation.
- `src/`: Contains the source code implementations for the key components and algorithms proposed in each pillar.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests and integration tests for the source code implementations.
- `data/`: Contains datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics used for empirical validation of each pillar.
