# Inclusive AI Transition

The Coronado Theory of Inclusive AI Transition pillar focuses on ensuring that the benefits and opportunities of advanced AI systems are widely shared across society, and that the risks and challenges are proactively addressed to minimize negative impacts on vulnerable and marginalized communities. As AI increasingly shapes key domains such as employment, healthcare, education, and social services, it is critical that the technology is developed and deployed in an inclusive and equitable manner.

## Anticipatory Impact Assessment

A key component of inclusive AI transition is the proactive assessment of the potential socioeconomic impacts of AI systems before and during their development and deployment. We propose the establishment of comprehensive AI impact assessment frameworks and methodologies that consider a wide range of factors, such as:

- Employment and labor market effects, including job displacement, skill demands, and wage inequality.
- Access to and quality of key services, such as healthcare, education, housing, and financial services.
- Fairness, bias, and discrimination in algorithmic decision-making systems.
- Privacy, surveillance, and civil liberties implications of AI-powered monitoring and profiling.
- Environmental and climate change impacts of AI-driven resource use and optimization.

By conducting rigorous and participatory impact assessments that engage diverse stakeholders, we can aim to anticipate and mitigate potential negative consequences of AI, particularly for vulnerable and underrepresented groups.

## Targeted Empowerment and Inclusion Initiatives

To ensure that the benefits of AI are inclusively shared, the Coronado framework proposes the development and implementation of targeted initiatives to empower and include marginalized communities in the AI economy. This could involve programs and policies such as:

- AI literacy and skills training to enable people from diverse backgrounds to understand, critique, and participate in the development and use of AI systems.
- Targeted investment and support for AI startups and entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups, such as women, minorities, and low-income communities.
- Inclusive design methodologies and practices that center the needs and perspectives of diverse users in the AI development process.
- Affirmative action and diversity initiatives to increase the representation of marginalized groups in AI research, education, and industry.
- Public engagement and deliberation mechanisms to give affected communities a voice in the governance and regulation of AI systems.

By proactively empowering and including marginalized communities in the AI transition, we can work towards a future in which the benefits of the technology are more equitably distributed.

## Social Safety Net and Support Systems

Given the potentially disruptive impacts of AI on employment and social systems, the Coronado framework emphasizes the importance of strengthening and adapting social safety nets and support structures to protect vulnerable populations during the transition. This could involve policies and programs such as:

- Universal basic income or negative income tax schemes to provide a minimum standard of living and reduce poverty and inequality.
- Lifelong learning and reskilling initiatives to help workers adapt to changing skill demands and career paths in an AI-driven economy.
- Affordable access to key services and infrastructure, such as healthcare, education, housing, and broadband internet.
- Mental health and social support services to help individuals and communities cope with the psychological and social stresses of technological change.
- Strengthened labor protections and collective bargaining power to ensure fair treatment and compensation for workers affected by automation.

By creating a robust and adaptive social safety net, we can aim to cushion the negative impacts of AI-driven disruption and ensure that no one is left behind in the transition.

## Empirical Validation Plan

To empirically validate and refine the inclusive AI transition framework, we propose a range of interdisciplinary research activities:

- Quantitative modeling and simulation studies to forecast the distributional impacts of AI across different demographic groups, regions, and sectors.
- Participatory action research and co-design methodologies to engage marginalized communities in the development and assessment of AI systems that affect them.
- Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental evaluations to test the effectiveness of targeted empowerment and inclusion initiatives in real-world settings.
- Ethnographic and longitudinal case studies to understand the lived experiences and coping strategies of communities undergoing AI-driven transitions.
- Comparative policy analysis and benchmarking to identify best practices and lessons learned from AI transition management across different contexts.

By combining multiple methods and perspectives, we aim to develop a nuanced and context-specific understanding of the challenges and opportunities for inclusive AI transition. Ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and iteration will be essential to ensure that the framework remains responsive to changing realities on the ground.
