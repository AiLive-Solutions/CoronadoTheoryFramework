# AI Safety

The Coronado Theory of AI Safety pillar focuses on ensuring that AI systems are developed and deployed in a way that minimizes risks and harms, and maximizes benefits and safety for individuals, society, and the environment. As AI systems become more powerful and autonomous, it is critical to proactively identify and mitigate potential safety risks across the full lifecycle of AI development and use.

## Comprehensive AI Safety Landscape

A key component of the AI safety theory is the development of a comprehensive ontology and taxonomy of AI safety risks and considerations. This involves systematically mapping the landscape of potential AI safety issues across different domains, levels of abstraction, and stages of the AI lifecycle.

The AI safety landscape includes a wide range of risks and considerations, such as:

- Technical safety risks, such as robustness, security, interpretability, and interruptibility of AI systems
- Ethical and social risks, such as fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy implications of AI
- Existential risks, such as the potential for misaligned superintelligence or weaponized AI
- Systemic risks, such as the impact of AI on employment, inequality, social cohesion, and geopolitical stability
- Environmental risks, such as the energy and resource footprint of AI training and deployment

The comprehensive AI safety landscape (Figure 15) provides a structured overview of the multidimensional space of AI safety risks and considerations. It organizes the risks into different categories, such as technical, ethical, existential, systemic, and environmental, and shows how they span different levels of abstraction and stages of the AI lifecycle. The landscape also highlights the interconnections and dependencies between different types of risks. By providing a holistic view of the AI safety challenge, this landscape can help guide the development of comprehensive and integrated approaches to AI safety.

## Proactive and Integrated Safety Practices

To operationalize AI safety considerations in practice, the Coronado framework proposes the integration of safety practices and safeguards throughout the entire AI development and deployment lifecycle. This involves a proactive and preventative approach to safety that aims to anticipate and design out risks from the earliest stages of AI system conceptualization and design.

Key elements of proactive and integrated AI safety practices include:

- Safety by design principles and methodologies that embed safety considerations into the core architecture, algorithms, and interfaces of AI systems
- Continuous testing and monitoring frameworks that enable the ongoing assessment and assurance of AI safety across different contexts and over time
- Incident response and mitigation plans that provide clear protocols and mechanisms for detecting, containing, and recovering from AI safety breaches or failures
- Safety culture and training programs that foster awareness, responsibility, and best practices for AI safety among all stakeholders involved in AI development and use

*Figure 16: Proactive and integrated AI safety practices*

The proactive and integrated AI safety practices (Figure 16) illustrate the end-to-end approach to incorporating safety considerations throughout the AI lifecycle. It shows how safety practices and safeguards are embedded at each stage, from the initial design and development of AI systems, to their testing, deployment, monitoring, and ongoing improvement. The practices work together to create a multi-layered defense against AI safety risks, with proactive measures to prevent issues from arising, and reactive measures to detect and respond to incidents. The circular arrows emphasize the continuous and iterative nature of AI safety assurance.

## Collaborative Safety Ecosystem

Ensuring the safety of AI systems is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires collaboration and coordination across multiple stakeholders and domains of expertise. The Coronado framework thus emphasizes the importance of fostering a collaborative ecosystem for AI safety that brings together diverse actors to share knowledge, coordinate efforts, and jointly address safety challenges.

Key elements of a collaborative AI safety ecosystem include:

- Multi-stakeholder partnerships and initiatives that bring together AI developers, domain experts, policymakers, civil society organizations, and the public to co-create AI safety solutions
- Open and interoperable standards and protocols for AI safety that enable consistent and reliable safety practices across different AI systems and domains
- Shared knowledge bases and tools for AI safety that pool resources, best practices, and lessons learned to accelerate collective progress on safety challenges
- Coordinated incident reporting and response systems that enable rapid information sharing and collaborative mitigation of AI safety incidents across organizations and jurisdictions

The collaborative AI safety ecosystem (Figure 17) depicts the network of stakeholders and initiatives involved in jointly addressing AI safety challenges. It shows the key actors, such as AI developers, domain experts, policymakers, and civil society organizations, and the various collaboration mechanisms that connect them, such as partnerships, standards, shared resources, and incident response systems. The density and strength of the connections represent the degree of coordination and alignment among stakeholders. The ecosystem approach emphasizes the importance of collective intelligence and action in tackling the complex and evolving landscape of AI safety risks.

## Empirical Validation Plan

To empirically validate and refine the AI safety framework, we propose a range of interdisciplinary research activities:

- Systematic mapping studies and meta-analyses to synthesize the existing knowledge base on AI safety risks and mitigation strategies across different domains and disciplines
- Empirical case studies and post-incident analyses to learn from real-world examples of AI safety successes, failures, and near-misses, and extract generalizable lessons and best practices
- Simulation studies and stress tests to rigorously assess the robustness and resilience of AI safety practices and safeguards under different scenarios and boundary conditions
- Participatory research and co-design methodologies to engage diverse stakeholders, especially those most affected by AI safety risks, in the development and evaluation of AI safety solutions
- Longitudinal impact assessments to monitor the long-term and systemic effects of AI safety practices and interventions on AI risks and benefits over time

By combining proactive design, rigorous empirical testing, and inclusive stakeholder engagement, we aim to develop a dynamic and evidence-based approach to AI safety that can effectively navigate the complex and evolving landscape of AI risks and benefits. Continuous learning and adaptation will be essential to ensure that the AI safety framework remains responsive to emerging challenges and opportunities as the science and practice of AI advances.
