# AI Value Alignment

The Coronado Theory of Value Alignment pillar tackles one of the most critical challenges in AI development: ensuring that advanced AI systems reliably pursue goals and exhibit behaviors aligned with human values. As AI systems become more autonomous and capable, the risk of misalignment between their objectives and those of their human creators grows, potentially leading to unintended and harmful consequences.

## Hybrid Value Learning Architecture

At the core of the value alignment theory is a novel hybrid approach to value learning that combines top-down ethical principles with bottom-up machine learning techniques. The top-down component involves developing a set of high-level ethical principles and values to serve as a framework for AI behavior, derived through philosophical analysis, cross-cultural dialogue, and empirical research on human moral psychology. These high-level principles are then translated into specific value functions and decision criteria to guide AI actions in particular domains, using a combination of expert elicitation, public deliberation, and machine learning techniques.

The bottom-up component involves using advanced machine learning methods, such as inverse reward design, preference learning, and active learning, to infer more granular human values and preferences from observational data and interactive feedback. The key innovation is a hierarchical architecture that integrates these top-down and bottom-up approaches (Figure 1). High-level ethical principles guide the learning of more specific value functions, which are then refined through interaction with humans and the environment. This allows for both the explicit encoding of human values and the flexibility to adapt to novel contexts.

## Formal Verification and Adversarial Testing

To ensure AI systems reliably optimize for the learned value functions, the Coronado Theory proposes a rigorous approach to value alignment using formal verification methods and adversarial testing. Techniques from control theory, game theory, and robustness analysis are used to design AI systems that are corrigible, interruptible, and robust to distributional shift and adversarial interference.

Formal verification methods, such as model checking and abstract interpretation, are used to mathematically prove that AI systems behave in accordance with their specified value functions. Adversarial testing and red teaming are employed to identify potential failure modes and edge cases by subjecting the systems to a range of simulated attacks and anomalous situations.

The end-to-end value alignment process (Figure 2) illustrates the comprehensive approach to ensuring AI systems reliably optimize for learned value functions. It spans the initial learning of value functions through techniques like inverse reward design and preference learning, the translation of these functions into action policies via planning and reinforcement learning, and the rigorous validation of these policies through formal verification methods and adversarial testing. This integrated process allows for the systematic encoding, implementation, and assurance of human values in AI systems.

## Empirical Validation Plan

To validate the hybrid value learning architecture and alignment methods, we propose a multi-pronged empirical research agenda:

- Human preference elicitation studies to uncover human values and priorities across diverse contexts, using surveys, interviews, and behavioral experiments.
- Development of standardized value learning benchmarks and evaluation metrics to enable comparative analysis of different techniques and architectures.  
- Simulation studies to rigorously test value alignment under varying conditions of uncertainty, distributional shift, and adversarial attack.
- Real-world case studies in collaboration with domain experts to pilot value alignment methods in high-stakes applications like autonomous vehicles, healthcare decision support, and financial trading systems.

By combining behavioral research, computational simulations, and ecologically valid case studies, we aim to provide comprehensive empirical support for the Coronado value alignment approach. Systematic testing across a range of domains and scenarios is critical to building confidence in the robustness and generalizability of the methods.
